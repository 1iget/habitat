  h2 Explore the Runtime Features of Habitat

  p This demo showcases some of the runtime features and capabilities of Habitat from the comfort of your browser. We'll explore capabilities such as built-in topology support, health monitoring, and dynamic configuration updates that make the runtime experience with Habitat great when running your own applications.

  h3 The Scenario

  p The example solution used in this demo is a standard two-tier application using Ruby-on-Rails and PostgreSQL. Both the Ruby-on-Rails front end and PostgreSQL back end have been packaged up as Habitat packages, so let's begin by starting up both packages and seeing what is happening behind the scenes.
