Every package needs a version number to use as part of its package identification and the <code>hab plan init</code> subcommand does not stub out a version for you. You have two options for adding versioning: 

* Explicitly add <code>pkg_version</code> to your plan.sh
* Use the <code>pkg_version()</code> and <code>update_pkg_version()</code> helper functions to compute <code>pkg_version</code>

 The following shows how to set <code>pkg_version</code>:

See [Basic settings](/docs/reference/basic-settings/) and [Utility functions](/docs/reference/utility-functions/) for more information on these versioning options.
