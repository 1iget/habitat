# <a name="overview">Overview</a>

Habitat centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure or operating system that the app runs on. This allows Habitat to be deployed and run on various infrastructure environments, such as bare metal, VM, containers, and PaaS.

The Habitat documentation is broken out into the following sections:

**Getting Started**

- [Tutorials](/tutorials): Location for our getting started and advanced tutorials. You should start here if you are new to Habitat.
- [Using Habitat](/docs/using-habitat/): Describes how to get started using Habitat.
