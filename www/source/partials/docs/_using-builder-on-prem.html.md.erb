In addition to our hosted service, we also support installing and running Habitat Builder on-premises, using your own network and infrastructure, which allows you to choose from a wider selection of authentication providers and to manage how Builder fits into your existing CI/CD processes.

For a detailed explanation of features, requirements and setup instructions, [see the GitHub repository](https://github.com/habitat-sh/on-prem-builder).
