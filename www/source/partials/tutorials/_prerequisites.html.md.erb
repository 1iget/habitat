    You will not be able to complete the tutorial without [Creating an origin](/tutorials/download/create-origin/), downloading the `hab` CLI, setting up your local environment, and running the `hab setup` command.

    > **Note**  The origin name you created in the Builder UI should match the one you specified in `hab setup`. 

* Install Docker Compose. 

    > **Note** If you already have <%= link_to 'Docker CE', 'https://www.docker.com/community-edition/', target: '_blank' %> for macOS or Windows installed and running on your workstation, then you are set up to use Docker Compose.
