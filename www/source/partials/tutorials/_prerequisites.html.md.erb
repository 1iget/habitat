## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have completed the following:

* All steps in the [Download and Install](/tutorials/download) section on your workstation. You will not be able
to complete the tutorial without [Creating an origin](/tutorials/download/create-origin/), downloading the `hab` CLI, setting up your local environment, and running the `hab setup` command.

    > **Note**  The origin name you created in the Builder UI should match the one you specified in `hab setup`. 

* Install <%= link_to 'Docker CE', 'https://www.docker.com/community-edition/', target: '_blank' %> on your workstation.

    > **Note** The minimum Docker version required for Habitat is greater than or equal to the version specified in the latest stable
    `core/docker` package, which currently is 1.31.1.

* If you want to use <%= link_to 'Builder', '/docs/glossary#builder', target: '_blank' %> to create your containers, make sure to have a <%= link_to 'Docker Hub account', 'https://hub.docker.com/', target: '_blank' %>. 

Also, we will be using Docker Compose in the tutorial. If you already have Docker Community Edition for Mac or Docker Community Edition for Windows installed and running, then you are set up to use Docker Compose. For Linux users, please follow the instructions to install <%= link_to 'Docker Compose', 'https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/', target: '_blank' %>.
