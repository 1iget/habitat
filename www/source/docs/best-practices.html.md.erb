# The Habitat Best Practices Guide
This chapter covers the Habitat Team's considered best practices for various runtime and build time activities that may be tangential to habitat's functionality. For example running habitat packages as containers in various schedulers, or wrapping pre-built binaries as habitat packages.

**Note:** This Guide is currently considered a WORK IN PROGRESS. Please pardon our dust and check back here regularly for more updates. 

We focus on best practices for packages that use Builder for continuous builds
