# Help Build Habitat

We have been hard at work on Habitat since fall 2015 and are very excited to share it with you, as an open-source project [licensed](/legal/licensing) under the Apache 2.0 License. You can find the source on the [Habitat GitHub repository](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat).

While we believe the foundational elements of Habitat are in place, there will always be more work to do to make sure that we provide the _best_ possible experience in building, deploying and managing applications in the real world. This is where we hope you'll come in and contribute to our community.


## Getting Involved
While the Habitat project is a framework for automating the lifecycle of your applications, contributing to Habitat doesn't necessarily come in the form of code (Yes, of course we are wildly happy to get code contributions). At this point we have some very thorough project documentation in the habitat repo and if you're interested in getting involved we would recommend reading the following two docs specifically.

  - [Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - [Contributing.md](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

As a young Apache2 licensed FOSS project being written by a mixture of open source veterans and distributed systems junkies we have **strong** opinions on the way we want the project and community to be governed. Our [code of conduct]((https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) is a great starting point for a new contributor because it will help you to understand what we value in our digital/physical interpersonal interactions. The Habitat community strives for safety of its members above all else.

Our [Contributing.md](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file, like most of our project documentation, is a living document that covers almost all of the aspects of project governance from our triage process, to support channels and workstation setup. It's a great jumping off point.

## Rust
I'm sure you know by the point you're reading this paragraph that the Habitat project is largely written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/). As an up and coming systems programming language rust may be a new language for you. We hope that doesn't dissuade you from getting involved. In our repo you'll find issues labeled with both `E-easy` and `E-mentored` each of these labels revolve around the projected effort level of the issue. If you're looking to cut your teeth on some rust, we'd highly encourage you to join the `#rust`` channel in the [habitat slack](habitat-sh.slack.com) and grab one of these issues to start Coding.

## Code-less contributions
For any new FOSS project adoption and ecosystem health are intrinsically linked. There are plenty of things you can contribute to the community that don't require you to learn Rust. For example, we're regularly writing [blog posts](/blog) and developing content for the community to consume around Habitat but there are only so many hours in a day! With that in mind, we've open sourced our blog content and would love for you to [write a blog post](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) about your experience with habitat.

Run a meetup in your town? We've even got slide decks we can share if you want to talk about Habitat but don't have time to build your own slides.

Interested in some social programming, or want to share something cool you're working on? Hop on one of our [livestreams](twitch.tv/habitatsh).

Then theres always [adding packages to the Core origin](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you've packaged something up that you think would be helpful to the community at large but you'd prefer it exist in the core plans repository, you can totally open a pr [over there](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core-plans). 

If you need any more suggestions on ways to contribute, drop by the [community slack](slack.habitat.sh) and ask in #general. I guarantee we can find plenty of ways for you to get involved.
